## Where Did I Get This?

> So I found this website called [EmulatorJS.com][EJS] and <br>
> I went into inspect and downloaded the resources.<br>
> <br>
> I removed the ad server, and made everything work within your own domain.<br>
> <br>
> [This repository] may soon make it possible to use all this open source.<br>
> <br>
> The emulator is not illegal - the rom is - I am not responsible <br>
> for what people decide to do with this software.
